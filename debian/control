Description: NGCP component to reduce amount of "lost" calls
 A component for NGCP that provides a failsafe mechanism to reduce amount
 of "lost" calls in case of unexpected system crashes. Creates intermediate
 records for ongoing calls based on acc start (INVITE) records and fixes
 "lost" calls based on last intermediate time.
